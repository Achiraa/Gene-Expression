# Luminal Progenitor Markers Analysis

## This project involves analyzing the expression levels of luminal progenitor markers using a dataset of log2 reads per million for various progenitor markers.
## The analysis includes creating grouped bar plots to visualize the expression levels of specific markers across different cell types and treatments.

## Files
Log2 Reads per million_progenitor markers.csv: The dataset containing log2 reads per million for progenitor markers.

analysis_script.R: The R script to perform the analysis and generate plots.
